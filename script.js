// This file is being refactored.
// The main application logic is moving to src/main.js and other modules.
// For Phase 1 of OOP refactoring, only authentication is expected to work via src/main.js.
// Other functionalities from this old script will be progressively moved or will be broken.

console.log("Old script.js is being phased out. See src/main.js.");

// To prevent errors from undefined functions if any old inline HTML event attributes still exist (should be removed):
function showFeedback(message, isError = false, targetDiv = null) {
    console.warn("Legacy showFeedback called:", message);
}
// Add other stubs for globally accessed functions from the old script if they cause errors during initial testing of Phase 1.
// However, ideally, index.html should not be calling any functions from here anymore.
// All event listeners and app initialization should start from src/main.js.
